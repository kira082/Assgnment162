What is RDD? Explain few features of RDD?

RDD- Resilient Distributed Dataset
It is the primary abstraction in Spark and is the core of Apache Spark.
One could compare RDDs to collections in Scala, i.e. a RDD is computed on
many JVMs while a Scala collection lives on a single JVM.

Features of RDD

Resilient, i.e. fault-tolerant with the help of RDD lineage graph and so
able to recompute missing or damaged partitions due to node failures

Distributed with data residing on multiple nodes in a cluster.

Dataset is a collection of partitioned data with primitive values or
values of values, e.g. tuples or other objects

Immutable or Read-Only, i.e. it does not change once created and can
only be transformed using transformations to new RDDs.

Lazy evaluated, i.e. the data inside RDD is not available or transformed
until an action is executed that triggers the execution.

Cacheable, i.e. you can hold all the data in a persistent "storage" like
memory
